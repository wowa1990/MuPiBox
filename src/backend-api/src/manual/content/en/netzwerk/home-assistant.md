# Home Assistant

With **Home Assistant** you can show and control the box: what is playing (with cover), volume, pause, next and previous, seeking in the track and where the box plays (speaker, headphone jack, Bluetooth headphones). Home Assistant also shows battery level, Wi-Fi signal, CPU load, temperature, memory and storage. The connection is encrypted (HTTPS) and only within the home network. In Home Assistant you need the **MuPiBox** integration from HACS.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the new connection through the box's Home Assistant interface. The older connection through an MQTT broker still exists ([MQTT and Home Assistant](mqtt.md)). You only need one of the two.

## Switching on

Under **Settings › Services › Home Assistant** switch on **Allow Home Assistant**. The box then accepts connections on port 8443 and announces itself in the home network (mDNS), so Home Assistant finds it by itself. With the switch off, nothing runs on the box for it.

## Pairing

1. In Home Assistant add the **MuPiBox** integration. The box shows up by itself; otherwise enter the address the app shows.
2. Home Assistant asks for the box's **key**. In the app tap **Copy key** under **Pair** and paste it into Home Assistant. The additional rights can be chosen there too (**messages and announcements**, **restart and switch off**).
3. In the app tap **Allow pairing (60 s)**, then **Submit** in Home Assistant.
4. If Home Assistant chose more than showing and controlling, the display asks first: **Allow all** or **Only show and control**.
5. The display shows a **six-digit code** and the rights Home Assistant gets. Enter the code in Home Assistant.

The key proves that Home Assistant is really talking to your box and not to another device in the network. So take it only from the app (or from the box's display, which shows it while pairing too), never from anywhere else. If copying does not work in the browser, the app selects the key and you copy it yourself.

The code is shown only on the box's display, so whoever enters it has the box in front of them. It is valid for 5 minutes and only once. After five wrong attempts the pairing ends, and it can be started again after a minute. The additional rights, too, can only be allowed on the display. To add or drop them later, go to **Configure** at the MuPiBox in Home Assistant: Home Assistant then pairs again (again with **Allow pairing** in the app, approval and code on the display) and removes the old pairing by itself.

## What else Home Assistant can do

- **Screenshot**: Home Assistant can show what is on the box's display right now. While a pairing is open there is no screenshot: the code is only for whoever stands at the box.
- **Update**: Home Assistant shows whether a newer version of the box exists. The update is still installed in the app.
- **Messages** (right "messages and announcements"): a short text appears on the display until its time is up or someone taps it.
- **Announcements** (right "messages and announcements"): the box speaks a text with its speech output. A voice has to be set under **Settings › Audio › Speech output** for this.
- **Restart and switch off** (right "restart and switch off"): the box restarts or shuts down, as with the button in the app.

During a quiet time the box shows no messages and speaks no announcements.

## Paired Home Assistants

Under **Paired** the app lists every Home Assistant with its rights. **Remove** ends the pairing at once. Home Assistant then has to be paired again.

## Good to know

- The volume from Home Assistant keeps to the box's maximum, with headphones to the limit for headphones.
- Listening time and quiet times apply to Home Assistant too. If playback is blocked, Home Assistant cannot start anything either.
- If the box's IP address or name changes, the pairing stays: the box's key does not change with it.
